### Clone, Install and run the project!

To run your tests again each time you make a modification, you can use the watch mode:

yarn/npm test --watch
```

You can also watch a specific file:

```bash
yarn/npm test --watch FILE_NAME
```

**_The tests will run inside your terminal._**

Inside the `__tests__` folder, there are tests that cover JavaScript concepts. The goal is to fix pass the test by assigning the right value to `__`.

Make sure to understand why each test case pass!
